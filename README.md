# vimfiles
My vim settings/plugins for easy setup in the future.

In Windows, clone this repo into %HOMEPATH%
In Unix, clone into $HOME and change folder name to .vim; may also need to move vimrc from folder to $HOME and rename to .vimrc.

####Notes

When running for the first time after adding plugins, run `:PluginUpdate` to update the help tags.
